**Clear explanations for a changing world**

## 🧠 What is vAIbes?

vAIbes is an AI education hub built for **late bloomers** — adults who feel behind on technology but want to understand AI without the jargon, hype, or assumptions that you're already technical.

We believe understanding AI shouldn't require a CS degree. Just curiosity.

No single answer is "correct" — understanding comes from comparing viewpoints.

## 📖 Philosophy

### Why "Late Bloomer"?
Because the tech world makes people feel stupid for not knowing things. We reject that.

**Our principles:**
1. **No question is too basic** - If you're asking, others are wondering too
2. **No jargon without explanation** - We define every technical term
3. **No hype, no fear** - AI is neither magic nor apocalypse
4. **Multiple perspectives matter** - One explanation rarely fits all
5. **Learning is non-linear** - You don't need to understand everything to use AI effectively
